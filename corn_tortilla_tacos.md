Corn tortillas

Ingredients: 

	- 2 cups Masa Harina
	- 1.5 cups of warm water
	- 1/2 teaspoon salt

Instructions: 
	- Add the 2 cups of Masa Harina and 1/2 teaspoon salt to a mixing bowl.
	- Add one cup of the warm water and stir until all of the water is absorbed.
	- Now start adding the rest of the warm water incrementally, a couple tablespoons at 
a time, and stirring regularly.
	- The idea is to keep adding water until the flour bits meld into a dough.  At that 
point you can pick it up with your hands and knead it together.
	- Next, separate the dough into golf ball sized chunks, rolling them between your 
hands to form a smooth ball.
